# Store Template

This project is a simple template for my projects. This project was not meant to be a whole solution to every problem and it's just a boilerplate to get projects quickly up and running.

## A few things to bear in mind:
- I developed this project with just two goals in mind.
  - First, I wanted to practice what I've learned in my free/spare time.
  - Second, I needed a sample project with proper piping and structure to make me faster.
- This project was not created by A Designer
  - You may find certain problems when you interact with UI. For instance, you might wonder why Cart Component does not have a Payment button. Some of these features/bugs were intentional to finish the project faster and some of them are just bugs that I might fix them later.
- Feel free to make a pull request and improve this in any way you may see fit, I'll merge it If it appeals to me either.
